## 1. Problem Statement
To design a Bot Flow for Cafe Bazza. The bot needs to be completely automated so as to have minimum agent interference unless absolutely required. The Bot Flow will first ask the user to select a language, with the options being Arabic and English. Depending upon user response the bot will provide the user with the menu with numerous options i.e. the services provided by the clinic as well as basic information like their location working hours and customer support. The bot will also provide the user to end the chat option. The bot can also assign the chat to the agents to take forward depending on user requirements.

## 5. Code Explaination
The Bot flow is such that there is maximum interaction of the user with the bot and minimal agent involvement. At any point in the conversation, the flow of the bot would not be interrupted. Even if there is an invalid response from the user the Bot will handle it with an invalid function redirecting the flow to the actual sequence. The flow has options wherein the user can end the chat and the session would be closed and resolved without any agent involvement. In the case the user requests customer support, he/she can access it at multiple points in the conversation.
